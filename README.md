This is where I'm going to store all of the little bits of code
that I do for personal projects.

## License and usage

Everything is under Apache-2 - as far as I understand it:
"you can use it as long as you don't claim it's yours".

I use a ton of things from other people - I tried to live links in the README:<br/>
"this is where I took it", which I hope is good enough.

Feel free to contact me if you have an issue with how I handled your work <br/>
(or if you have other reasons).

## Algo

Collection of mostly stl-like algorithms and some general purpose data-structures.

### factoriadic_representation

`compute_factoriadic_representation_length`<br/>
`from_factoriadic_representation`<br/>
`to_factoriadic_representation`

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system)

Converts a number to it's factoriadic representation.<br/>
Go left to to right with increasing digits.<br/>
Zero is always present (0!) - this allows to do the algorithm better.<br/>

```
0 => { 0 }
1 => { 0 1 }
2 => { 0 0 1 }
3 => { 0 1 1 }
```

Representation comes out left is smallest digit.

### factorial

`factorial`

Computes a factorial of an input number.

### find_nth

`find_nth_guarantied`<br/>
`find_nth_if_guarantied`

Similar to std::find/find_if but returns nth_entry instead of the first one.
_guarantied variations don't check for boundaries.

Indexing is from 0 - find 0th returns the first encouted element.

### make_vector_of_iterators

`make_vector_of_iterators`

For a range returns a vector with iterators for each element.
Had a choice to use this or pointers, decided for iterators - since they can<br/>
support more relaxed iterator concepts from C++20.

### memoized_function

`memoized_function`

A wrapper around a callable, that stores outputs for previously computed inputs.
Not terribly efficient - currently uses std::map to implement storage.

### nth_permutation

`nth_permutation`

[Medium blog](https://medium.com/@aiswaryamathur/find-the-n-th-permutation-of-an-ordered-string-using-factorial-number-system-9c81e34ab0c8)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system)

Gives nth lexicographical permutation of the sequence, assuming that the original sequence <br/>
is sorted. (doesn't rely on the original order in any way).<br/>

Permuntations are counted from 0.

_NOTE_: One has to always start from the first sequence, this **DOES NOT MAKE SENCE**:
```
nth_permutation(f, l, o, n);
nth_permutation(f, l, o, n);
```

_NOTE_: Since permutation number might be really big for even small range can be huge,<br/>
consider using big number library.

_NOTE_: algorithm can potentially be done in place but it's hard and unneccary.

Allocates O(distance(f, l)) memory.

### unroll

`unroll`

Repeat the same operation multiple types without the loop.

## Bench (generic/runnable)

Collection of benchmarks and some tools to do benchmarks.
Generic - templates that do things and reusable things.
Runnable - Specificly crafted *.cc files, each one of which is conerted to it's own benchmark executable (sometimes multiple).

Depends on google benchmark and boost.

_NOTE_: I don't know how to CMAKE - dependencies are found in installed folders.

### declaration

`BENCH_DECL_ATTRIBUTES`

Still in the hopes to find some magic attibutes that would help with the code alignment.
For now - just noinline, to help when looking at assembly.

### input_generators

`int_to_t`<br/>
`sorted_vector`<br/>
`two_sorted_vectors`

Utils to generate data for benchmarks.

### merge

`merge_common`<br/>
`merge_int_vec`

Benchmarking merge like algorithms.

### sort

`sort_common`<br/>
`sort_int_vec`

Benchmarking sort like algorithms.

## Scripts

### benchmark_visualization

To use the script insert this line into your html file.

TODO: update

```
<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DenisYaroshevskiy/algorithm_dumpster@<COMMIT>/scripts/benchmark_visualization.js"></script>

It's adviasable to specify the commit otherwise you might run into issues with long term caching.
