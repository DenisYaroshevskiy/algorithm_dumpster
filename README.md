This is where I'm going to store all of the little bits of code
that I do for personal projects.

### Becnhmarking visualisation scrip.

To use the script insert this line into your html file.

TODO: update

<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DenisYaroshevskiy/algorithm_dumpster@<COMMIT>/scripts/benchmark_visualization.js"></script>

(Replace the commit with the one you one).
It's adviasable to specify the commit otherwise you might run into issues with long term caching.
